-----------------

This is a web-based 'To-Do-List' app.
I'm writing this to practice working on basic HTML/CSS/Javascript along with manipulating the DOM.
Coded entirely w/ vanilla Javascript and no jQuery.

Currently a work-in-progress.  

9 April 2015: 
-Added input field keypress event handler for "Add Date" feature.
-Removed anonymous function calls.
-Refactored variable/function names and operation flow.
-Modified date format
-Added CSS class to style input field w/ alternate color when entering due date

Upcoming revisions: 
Add "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for individual tasks

-----------------

19 March 2015: Added Task Completion feature.
Still some major bugs in transferring tasks from 'To-Do' to 'Complete' status.
Upcoming revisions:

- remove anonymous functions from .addEventListener and .removeEventListener calls
- delegate seperate functions for specific tasks
- refactor variable and function names to be non-specific
