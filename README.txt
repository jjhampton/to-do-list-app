-----------------

This is a web-based 'To-Do-List' app.
I'm writing this to practice working on basic HTML/CSS/Javascript along with manipulating the DOM.

Currently a work-in-progress.

19 March 2015: Added Task Completion feature.
Still some major bugs in transferring tasks from 'To-Do' to 'Complete' status.
Upcoming revisions:

- remove anonymous functions from .addEventListener and .removeEventListener calls
- delegate seperate functions for specific tasks
- refactor variable and function names to be non-specific
